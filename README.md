# Cross-Chain Realitio Proxy

Enables cross-chain arbitration for Realitio (Reality.eth) on Gnosis or other AMB-compatible networks using Kleros as arbitrator.

## High-Level Flow Description

1. Alice requests arbitration on the main chain paying the arbitration fee to the ETH proxy and indicates the maximum value of the bond for the question (A.K.A. `max_previous`).
1. The ETH proxy communicates the request to the Gnosis proxy through the AMB.
1. The Gnosis tries to notify Realitio of the arbitration request and forwards the `max_previous` value:
   1. If the bond has not changed, the arbitration request will be accepted.
      1. Notify the ETH proxy through the AMB.
   1. Otherwise, if it changed then:
      1. Notify the ETH proxy through the AMB.
      1. The ETH proxy refunds Alice. **END**
1. In the mean time while Realitio was being notified of the arbitration request, the arbitration fees might have changed:
   1. If the fees stayed the same (most common case) then:
      1. Create a dispute on Kleros Court.
   1. If the fees have decreased then:
      1. Create a dispute on Kleros Court.
      1. Refund Alice of the difference.
   1. If the fees have increased, then the arbitration request will fail:
      1. Refund Alice of the value paid so far.
      1. The ETH proxy notifies the Gnosis proxy through the AMB that the arbitration failed to be created.
      1. The Gnosis proxy notifies Realitio of the failed arbitration. **END**
1. The Kleros court gives a ruling. It is relayed to the Gnosis proxy through the AMB.
   1. If the ruling is the current answer, Bob, the last answerer, is the winner. **END**
   1. If it is not, Alice is the winner. **END**

### Repo Structure

Each directory at the root of this repository contains code for each individual part that enables this integration:

- **`bots/`**: service to automate some steps of the flow which otherwise would required manual intervention from users.
  - **Notice:** while this is a centralized service, it exists only for convenience. Users can fulfill the role of the bots if they wish to.
- **`contracts/`**: Smart contracts to enable cross-chain arbitration for Realitio (Reality.eth). [Learn more](contracts/README.md).
- **`dynamic-script/`**: allows fetching the dynamic content for the arbitration, as described by [ERC-1497: Evidence Standard](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/1497).
- **`evidence-display/`**: display interface that should be used to render the evidence for arbitrators, as described by [ERC-1497: Evidence Standard](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/1497).
